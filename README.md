hi ,
Welcome to my Projects repo,
This was a project Driven out of curiosity where a Car with 2 motor speed controlled by PWM , was ran by a controller in a android Mobile App called Node MCU car,
Basic working is as Follows-
1) The App in smartphone sends some charaters as output to ESP32 wifi module upon pressing a Partuculr key such as Forward "F" Backward "B"
2) Then the received charecter from Mobile App is received in ESP 32 is fed to the micrcontroller
3) The microcontroller in loop checks the charecter and performs a function call according to the key Presses by user in APP
   That's the FULL working ,Thanks for reading,
feel free to improve this code !
